libmpcdec: libmpcdec (A library for playing Musepack files)
libmpcdec:
libmpcdec: Libmpcdec is used for playing Musepack files. Musepack is an audio
libmpcdec: compression format with a strong emphasis on high quality. It's
libmpcdec: not lossless, but it is designed for transparency, so that you
libmpcdec: won't be able to hear differences between the original wave file
libmpcdec: and the much smaller MPC file. It is based on the MPEG-1
libmpcdec: Layer-2/MP2 algorithms, but since 1997 it has rapidly developed
libmpcdec: and vastly improved and is now at an advanced stage in which it
libmpcdec: contains heavily optimized and patentless code.
